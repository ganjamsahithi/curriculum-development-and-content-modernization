📌 Overview

This project proposes the implementation of an Agentic AI Curriculum Designer that assists educators in rapidly updating and modernizing academic content. By leveraging LangChain and CrewAI, the system enables collaborative curriculum development, ensuring that learning materials remain relevant, research-driven, and aligned with industry needs.

🚀 Key Components
1. LangChain

Handles research and content synthesis.

Gathers and organizes knowledge from multiple sources.

Ensures the curriculum integrates the latest academic research and trends.

2. CrewAI

Enables collaborative curriculum development through AI agents.

Coordinates specialized agents such as:

Subject Matter Expert Agent → Ensures academic accuracy.

Instructional Design Agent → Structures and optimizes learning experiences.

🎯 Benefits for Educators

Rapid Updates → Quickly align teaching content with new research and industry demands.

Curriculum Relevance → Integrates emerging technologies and evolving industry standards.

Efficiency → Reduces the manual workload for educators while improving content quality.

Future-Readiness → Prepares students with skills needed for dynamic job markets.

⚙️ Workflow

Research Phase → LangChain aggregates and synthesizes content.

Design Phase → CrewAI agents collaborate (subject matter + instructional design).

Integration Phase → Updated curriculum is structured for delivery.

Review Phase → Educators validate and finalize content.

🛠️ Technologies

LangChain – Research & Knowledge Integration

CrewAI – Collaborative Multi-Agent System

✅ Outcome

A modern, adaptive, and AI-driven curriculum development system that empowers educators to deliver up-to-date, industry-relevant, and engaging learning experiences.
